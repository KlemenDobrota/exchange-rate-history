# exchange-rate-history

The script checks xml url link - Bank of Slovenia and gets the exchange rate of the requested currency on requested date.
Script is in Slovenian language - I made it for my self, but it's easy to translate it to any language.
If your bank is providing online url link with data, you have to cusomize the script accordingly.
